Exam Type		: Quiz 3 		 

Question (Basic part: 100 points). Assume that you are given a file named Quiz3_Data.txt.

Define a data structure to hold this data for 5 students, read data from the file and populate your data structure. Having read the data, now sort the data with respect to (w.r.t.) students’ heights and print both unsorted and the sorted data. 

Optional (for 50 additional point): In the basic case you are asked to order the data w.r.t. students’ heights. If you, instead, parametrize the ordering, that is order the data according the user’s choice (Name, Lname, Age, Height, Grades, or Addresses) you would earn an additional 50 points on this quiz.
